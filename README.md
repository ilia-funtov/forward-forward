# forward-forward
Implementation of the forward-forward algorithm for neural networks

Rework of https://github.com/mpezeshki/pytorch_forward_forward

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks:
- `1_mnist_original_forward_forward.ipynb`: the code writtent by Mohammad Pezeshki (https://github.com/mpezeshki) converted into a notebook
- `2_mnist_refactored_forward_forward.ipynb`: the refactored version of the first notebook; the labels are concatenated with the inputs instead of being overlayed on top of them
